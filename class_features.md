# Level 1: Spellcasting PHB'14 p99

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic.  
This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.  
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.  

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.  
You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.  

### Spell Slots

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher.  
To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  


For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.  

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.  
You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th.  
Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  
For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.  

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world.  
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.  

Spell save DC = 8 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus  
Spell attack modifier = Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus  

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.  

## Level 1: Sorcerous Origin PHB'14 p99

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power, from the list of available origins.  
Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.  

### Clockwork Soul TCE p68

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic.  
That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it-a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency.  
You, or someone from your lineage, might have become entangled in the machinations of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus.  
Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March.  
Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.  

## Level 1: Clockwork Magic TCE p68

1st-level Clockwork Soul feature

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork Spells table.  
Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.  


Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.  

| Clockwork SpellsSorcerer Level | Spells                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st                            | alarm, protection from evil and good  |
| 3rd                            | aid, lesser restoration               |

| 7th                            | freedom of movement, summon construct |
| 9th                            | greater restoration, wall of force    |

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your sorcerer spells.  

### Manifestations of Order

|   6   | The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic |

## Level 1: Restore Balance TCE p68

1st-level Clockwork Soul feature

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  

## Level 2: Font of Magic PHB'14 p99

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

### Creating Spell Slots

You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.  

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1st              | 2                  |
