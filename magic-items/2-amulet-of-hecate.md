# Amulet of Hecate

Wondrous item, requires attunement by spellcaster

A bronze amulet adorned with the icons of two crossed torches, that of Hecate.  
The magic and spite oozing from it fills you with magic power, and the goddesses magical nature starts its work anew.

You can use the amulet as a spellcasting focus for your spells while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your sorcerer spells of +1.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the amulet, you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability score, and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use that ability.
