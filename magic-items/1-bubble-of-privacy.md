# The Bubble of Privacy

Wondrous Item, uncommon (Requires attunement)

This small slightly worn crystal bead is encased in yellow glowing gum arabic, marked with a faint smudge of red nail polish.  
A subtle groove along its surface seems to pulse with arcane potential when touched.
While holding the bead, you can press the groove to release either one of two magical effects:

- Sheltering Dome
  - As an action, you can press the groove to cast `Leomund’s Tiny Hut`.
- Containment Field
  - use your action to press the groove while pointing the bead toward a creature within range, casting `Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere` with a Spell Save DC of 15.

Once the bead has been used to cast either spell, it can’t be used again until after a long rest.

A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration.  
The spell ends if you leave its area.  
Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you.  
The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures.  
Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely.  
All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it.  
Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it.  
The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark.  
The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.

A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range.  
An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.  

On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there.  
The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.  
The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside.  
An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed.  
Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.  
A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.
