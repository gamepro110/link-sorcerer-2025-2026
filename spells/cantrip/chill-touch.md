##

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range.  
Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave.  
On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.  
Until then, the hand clings to the target.
