##

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you.  
Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a constitution saving throw.  
On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.  
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

## higher levels
